BookLoop is a mobille application, targeting both Android and iOS devices, which aims to provide a place for users to exchange/sell books, talk based on them and to socialize based on this common hobby. Because it is quite hard to establish readers circles, I thought this application would be useful for some users.

The application allows the users to sign up and login based on their account and to manage their settings and credentials. Users can see post offers from other users, which might be of 3 types: sell, exchange or donation. Clicking on a post displays the details about it and gives the possibility to start a chat with the owner.

Users can also create their own posts, delete them when no longer available, filter other users' posts. The main posts screen offers pagination and lazy loading for making the app faster.

The second part of the application is the chatting part. You can chat with your contacts or start a new conversation by providing a username. You can also create groups, by providing at least 3 usernames (yours included) and a group name. The chat ensures instant messages, so that users can communicate in real time.
